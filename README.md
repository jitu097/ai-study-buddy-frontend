## 🤖 Vercel v0 Usage (Short Notes)

I used **Vercel v0** to generate the major UI components of this landing page.  
The **Hero Section, Features Section, Testimonials Section, and Pricing Section** were designed with V0’s AI component generator and exported as Next.js components.  
I customized the colors, layout, and spacing to match the theme of **AI Study Buddy**.  
Using Vercel v0 helped maintain clean UI consistency and sped up the component creation process.  
The Footer section was built manually.
